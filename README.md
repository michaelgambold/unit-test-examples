# Unit Test Examples

This repo has examples of how to do unit testing/mocking/spying with different
programing languages/frameworks.

There is a different project/folder for each variation that will contain it's
own README on how to run the project. The format will be
`PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE-TESTING_FRAMEWORK`.

Every example will implement same functionality (as far as code goes) and
will test/mock/spy on the same thing. This will give a direct comparison
for the different programming language/testing frameworks.

Code coverage reporting (at some level) will also be included for reference.
